# sass-boilerplate
This is a very basic starting point for new web projects. It takes no assumptions about your tech stack and there is no binding to any javascript frameworks or backend systems.

The boilerplate includes gulp, sass, sourcemaps, autoprefixer, breakpoint and browsersync. And nothing else.

## Requirements

**[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) v4.x.x - v6.9.x .**

## Quickstart
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/olefredrik/sass-boilerplate.git
$ cd sass-boilerplate
$ npm install
$ gulp
```
